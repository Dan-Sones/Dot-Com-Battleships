<p>Made from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Head-First-Java-Kathy-Sierra/dp/0596009208/ref=sr_1_1?crid=IVYDUNEETBV8&dchild=1&keywords=head+first+java&qid=1588790309&sprefix=headfirs%2Caps%2C140&sr=8-1">Head First Java</a> following the info from chapter 6</p>

<h2>How to it works</h2>
<ol>
    <li>3 DotComs are postioned on the virtual grid and are then assigned names</li>
    <li>The user is then given instructions on how to play</li>
    <li>The user then guesses the postioning of the three ships/DotComs</li>
    <li><ul><li>If the users guess if correct hit will be printed</li><li>If the user has 3 hits on eh same Dotcom/Ship then kill will be displayed</li></ul></li>
    <li>Repeat steps 3-4 untill all DotComs/ships are killed</li>
    <li>Depending on how many guesses it took the user a certain message will be displayed to them which either congratulates them or tells them they arer really bad!</li>
</ol>
